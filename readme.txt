==========================
= Advanced Configuration =
==========================

	======================
	= Advanced Secuitems =
	======================
	The Secure Hosting and Payments system supports the facility to secure your 
	checkout from tempering, the facility is supported by the Advanced Secuitems 
	feature. In order for the Advanced Secuitems to work correctly, it must be correctly 
	configured in both the Open Cart admin interface and your Secure Hosting and 
	Payments account. The settings for the Advanced Secuitems within your Secure 
	Hosting and Payments account are found within the Advanced Settings section 
	of the account.

1.	Activate Advanced Secuitems - In order to activate use of the Advanced Secuitems, 
	set to "Yes". You will also need to activate the feature within your Secure 
	Hosting and Payments account, this is performed by checking the below setting:
	
	Activate advanced secuitems security
	
	In addition to activating the Advanced Secuitems in your Secure Hosting and 
	Payments account, you must enter "transactionamount" into the list of fields 
	to be encrypted.
	
2.	Advanced Secuitems Phrase - When securing your checkout, the Secure Hosting 
	and Payments system uses a unique phrase to create it's encrypted string. The 
	phrase entered into your Open Cart web site here must match the phrase configured 
	within the Advanced Settings section of your Secure Hosting and Payments account 
	otherwise the system will block your transactions.
	
3.	Shopping Cart Referrer - As part of the security in generating the encrypted 
	string, the Secure Hosting and Payments system needs to very the shopping cart 
	request, this is done by checking the referrer. The referrer configured here 
	must match the referrer configured within your Secure Hosting and Payments account 
	within the Advances Settings. An example referrer for your site would be 
	"http://www.mysite.com/index.php".

	=================
	= Shared Secret =
	=================
	The Open Cart integration used the Callbacks from Secure Hosting feature to 
	update itself, confirming that an order has been placed. In order to prevent 
	the callback from Secure Hosting being spoofed, the Secure Hosting and Payments 
	system supported a Shared Secret value which is used to generate a unique verification 
	string which could only have been generated by Secure Hosting and Payments.

4.	Shared Secret - In order to activate the Share Secret callback verification, 
	enter your Shared Secret value in the Open Cart admin interface and within the 
	Advanced Settings of your Secure Hosting and Payments account. The Shared Secret 
	value can be anything you want, it just needs to be the same in both Open Cart 
	and Secure Hosting and Payments.
	
5.	Test Mode - The Secure Hosting and Payments system can run in test mode and 
	processes your transactions as test transaction. Change this setting to True 
	to use the test mode. Don't forget to change this back to False before going live!
